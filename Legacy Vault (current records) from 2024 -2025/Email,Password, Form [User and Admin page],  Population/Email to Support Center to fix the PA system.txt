We hope this email finds you well. For a few days now, the audio PA system in the mosque has been faulty. The microphone used to project the prayers to the ladies' side is now defectuous. This has been very inconvenient in regard to prayers, especially for the ladies, who are now unable to follow important parts of the it.

So far, we have been able to coordinate the prayers so that they could at least follow us, and we have also tried repairing the faulty equipment, but without much success. 

We thereby ask for your assistance to solve this issue and replace the faulty piece of equipment. Please let us know if anything.


Best regards,
