As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,

Beloved Brothers and Sisters, and cherished guest(s),

	Today, we gather with hearts filled with mixed emotions—joy for the accomplishments of our graduating Class of 2024 and a touch of sadness as we prepare to say goodbye. This is a momentous occasion, a celebration of hard work, perseverance, and the beautiful journey that each of you has embarked upon during your time at Ashesi.

As you stand on the threshold of a new chapter in your lives, I want to take a moment to reflect on the incredible journey you have undertaken. Each of you has faced challenges, embraced opportunities, and grown not only as students but as individuals. You have learned to think critically, engage with diverse perspectives, and develop the skills necessary to navigate an ever-changing world. 

In the Quran, Allah (SWT) reminds us, “And He has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals tents which you find light on the day of travel and when you stop for rest.” (Surah An-Nahl (Surah 16), 80). Just as He has provided us with comfort and guidance, you have found your own homes here at Ashesi—places of learning, friendship, and spiritual growth.


As you prepare to step into the world beyond these walls, I urge you to carry with you the values of discipline and mindfulness. The world outside can be overwhelming, filled with distractions and challenges that may test your faith and resolve. Our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW) taught us the significance of discipline in our lives. He said, “The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, while there is good in both. Strive for that which will benefit you, seek help from Allah, and do not feel helpless.”

Discipline is not merely about adhering to rules; it is about cultivating a mindset that prioritizes your goals while remaining steadfast in your faith. As you navigate your careers and personal lives, let your actions reflect the values of Islam—integrity, compassion, and respect for others.


In this journey, do not forget the importance of enhancing your Iman (faith). Your Iman will be your anchor in times of uncertainty. Engage in regular prayers, seek knowledge, and surround yourselves with individuals who inspire and uplift you. Remember the words of Allah (SWT): “Indeed, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.” (Surah Ar-Ra'd (Surah 13), 28). 

Make time for reflection and gratitude. Acknowledge the blessings in your life, and remain connected to your community. Your faith will guide you through the trials and tribulations that life may present. 



	To our continuing students, as you prepare for your short break, I encourage you to use this time wisely. Rest, rejuvenate, and reflect on your own journeys. Remember that every moment is an opportunity for growth, both academically and spiritually. Engage in activities that enrich your knowledge and strengthen your bonds with one another. 

As you return to school in a few weeks, approach your studies with enthusiasm and commitment. You are the future leaders of our community, and your actions today will shape the world of tomorrow. 


As we bid farewell to the Class of 2024, let's remember that this is not an end but a new beginning. You carry with you the knowledge, experiences, and values that you have cultivated during your time here. Embrace the future with courage and confidence, knowing that you are equipped to make a positive impact in the world.

May Allah (SWT) bless each of you with success and wisdom as you embark on this new journey. May your paths be illuminated with His guidance, and may you always find strength in your faith.

Jazakum Allahu Khairan for your attention, 

Wassalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.
