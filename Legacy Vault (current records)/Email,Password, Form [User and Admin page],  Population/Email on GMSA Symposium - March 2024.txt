Subject: Invitation to Ramadan Conference by GMSA

Dear Ashesi Community,

We trust this message finds you well. We are delighted to inform you that the Ashesi Muslim Community has been extended a special invitation to an upcoming Pre-Ramadan Symposium centered on Ramadan by the Ghana Muslim Students' Association (GMSA) National Secretariat. 

The event is scheduled to take place on Saturday, 9th March 2024. This conference presents a unique opportunity for our Muslim community members to engage in discussions, share experiences, and celebrate the significance of Ramadan. In order to represent our community effectively, we are looking to send a delegation of 20 people to participate in this enriching event. If you are a member of the Ashesi Muslim Community and are interested in attending this conference on behalf of our community, we kindly request you to sign up for this event immediately. 

Your participation will not only contribute to the diversity and inclusivity of our community but also provide you with a valuable platform to connect with fellow students and engage in meaningful dialogue. Please note that the sign-up will close by the end of tomorrow. We look forward to your enthusiastic participation and representation at the Symposium. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at 0558032476 for both calls and WhatsApp. Thank you for your attention, and we anticipate a strong turnout from our vibrant Ashesi Muslim Community.


Warm regards,
The Ashesi Muslim Community.
