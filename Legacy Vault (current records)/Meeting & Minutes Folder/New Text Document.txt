Assalamulaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatu,

May Allah help us all continue the good habits we have acquired during Ramadan and avoid habits that are detrimental to us.


First of all, please let's not cause tension here. If you have questions, concerns or suggestions, pls ask me or any of the executives. Thursday is the day of Eid, we will follow the National stipulation endorsed by our esteemed Chief Imam.


So here is the break down of our plans:

1. If you have fasted for 30 days currently, pls don't fast tomorrow. For those who have fasted for 29 days, we should leave it to their discretion whether or not to fast tomorrow, Insha Allah. I am open to correction if I am wrong.

2. We have procured 3 buses for Thusday. Each bus has 30 seats, meaning a total of 90 seats. Insha Allah, we will have everyone on board,so don't worry about what happens if we have more than 90 people taking the bus.


3. The bus will arrive very early, before 6am. Everyone has to be seated by 6:10am. The bus willtake off at 6:30am.

4. After Eid prayers, everyone will scatter around. Sometimes, it is difficult to get everyone together. We do not want anyone to go missing, so pls save the contacts of the current or past executives, incase the worse happens.

5. There may be snacks available to us in the bus on our way back to campus. We tried to provide food but most of the money went into transport fare. and

I will keep up will further updates, please read the messages. Some peeple do not read the messages on this platform. This is one of the causes of tension and miscommunication among us.
