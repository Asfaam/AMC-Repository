Assalamu Alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,
Dear Beloved Brothers and Sisters, please allow me to introduce to you the current AMC Executives:

Abdoul Raouf Munkaila - Vice President
Alhassan Furqaan - Chief Imaam
Afa Musah - Dept. Chief Imaam

Morro Sulleyman - Finance Secretary/Treasurer
Mansura Mahabab - Women Commissioner

Note: Please pay special attention to Morro Sulleyman, our Finance Secretary/Treasurer, responsible for collecting dues for our upcoming Eid-ul Fitr plans.

About the Dues:
We aim to observe Eid prayers at Kanda, Accra, followed by a celebration. To make this possible, we need each member to contribute GHS 100.00. Payments will be collected by Morro Sulleyman from the 1st day to the 15th day of Ramadan. Our target is 80 contributors; failing to reach this goal will result in refunds and cancellation of our trip.

Call to Action:
Let us all participate actively in this initiative to ensure a successful Eid celebration together.

Request for Assistance:


May Allah bless our collective efforts and strengthen our unity.

Walaikum Salamu Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,

President, Ashesi Muslim Community (AMC)
